PEDESTRIAN TRACKING PREDICTION MODEL


1. Overview of Problem Statement
Pedestrian tracking plays a critical role in various applications, including autonomous vehicles, crowd management, and safety monitoring. However, accurately predicting pedestrian movements is challenging due to the complex interplay of spatial and temporal features. Developing an effective prediction model can aid in better decision-making and safety managemen
2. Objective.
To develop a pedestrian tracking prediction model using machine learning techniques.
